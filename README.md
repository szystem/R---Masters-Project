Clustering Dirichlet distributed data evolving in time, using the EM algorithm

In my master's project I extend the possibilities of the EM algorithm to cluster a Dirichlet distributed data evolving in time. Project consists of a number of steps:
1. Programming a simple EM algorithm for normally distrubuted data
2. Adjusting the algorithm for the dirichlet distribution
3. Developing the model suitable for a data consisting of observations evolving in time
4. Testing the algorithm on a synthetic data set
5. Cleaning and preparing a real-life data set - marital statuses in countries in different group ages
6. Applying the algorithm for the real data
